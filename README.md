# NCLScripts
Some scripts that I wrote when competing at National Cyber League - Post Season competition. I will add more scripts when I compete in future. 


# Scripts history

* logIIS.py - A python script wrote to analyze the iis log file they gave us
* brute.py - A simple python script to generate "passphrases" from adjective + noun + 2 digits and compare that to the hash given.
